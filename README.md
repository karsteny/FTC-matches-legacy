# FTC-matches
This is old deprecated code. Also it features some of the worst coding in the history of JS/HTML (imagine trying to beat JS into being object oriented!)
It will probably still work so long as you set the year to the correct time but otherwise it needs a deep rewrite.

### How 2 Install

##### Step 1: 
Download/clone all of the files from this repository into a single folder. 

##### Step 2: 
Go to chrome://extensions. Make sure "Developer Mode" is turned on.

> Note: Currently an event MUST be from the 2023 season.

Event codes can be found at (https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org). You can type your team number in the search bar at the top and select an event you want (again, currently only from the 2023 season).
